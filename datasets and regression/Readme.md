# Instructions to run the code

## Requirements

Before running the code, these need to be installed:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy
   
## Instructions for Each Dataset

1. Open the terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the files.

3. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python dataset1.py dataset2.py dataset3_1.py dataset3_2.py

# General

- In the Jupyter notebook, post uploading the files and the datasets attached, everything that needs to be done is running these commands: python3 dataset1.py, python3 dataset2.py, python3 dataset3_1.py, python3 dataset3_2.py in the command line of the terminal.

- The codes have been attached in the .py files with the corresponding datasets.

- The images corresponding to the dataset1, dataset2, dataset 3 have been saved as image1.png, image2_1.png, image2_2.png, image3_1.png. image3_2.png corresponding to each of them.

- Image2_1.png, Image2_2.png correspond to the least squares and the best curve fit images
